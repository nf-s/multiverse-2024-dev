## Camping

Please stick to the designated camping area. You can bring your own food and drinks, but only for personal use, not for sale. Gas Cookers are permitted for outdoor use. Do not use gas cookers in your tent! If fire safety conditions change and this policy changes, you will be informed upon entry to the festival. There should be ample space for all attendees, but please do not use more than you require.

## Road Safety

Road safety is a big priority so make sure you drive safely on the way to and from the festival. Make sure you have slept enough before doing the drive. Do not drive under the influence of alcohol or any other substances.

## Sneak-ins Policy

Unfortunately there are some people who choose to sneak in to the festival to avoid paying or contributing. This is super disrespectful to everyone who does the right thing. Anyone found to be sneaking in will be removed from the Festival site, as will anyone found to be assisting them. For those who have a genuine problem with affording an entry ticket we encourage you to pursue volunteer work opportunities, or to contact the organisers.

## Conditions Of Entry

Management reserves the right to refuse entry & unsociable behaviour will not be tolerated. All cars entering the property may be subject to inspection for compliance with our event policies. This is a condition of entry to the event. The Festival rules listed above are also conditions of entry and failure to observe these rules may result in eviction from the festival.
